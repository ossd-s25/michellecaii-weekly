# Reflection on "Why should you have and Open Source Program Office?"

I watched the video on how many large companies starting to incorporate Open Source Program Offices. I thought this would be interesting as I had previously looked into Google's and Redhat's open source program offices. 

Watching this video deepened my understanding of how structured open source engagement can empower both companies and individuals. I hadn’t fully considered the strategic role that an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) plays—not just in compliance, but in shaping culture, encouraging innovation, and fostering community relationships.

What stood out to me most was the dual role of the OSPO as both a facilitator and a safeguard. It acts as a bridge between developers and legal/compliance teams, allowing engineers to contribute meaningfully to open source while minimizing risks to the company. I appreciated how the video framed open source not as a side effort but as a core part of a modern organization's identity and long-term strategy.

# Class Discussion Reflection on Open Source in Business

In class, we also talked about how open source fits into business. One point that came up was how more companies are starting to play a bigger role as contributors to open source projects. It’s not just about giving back; it’s also a smart way to build influence and shape the tools they rely on.

What really caught my attention was the idea that open source isn’t just one business model. It actually supports a bunch of different ones, like dual licensing, SaaS products, or offering support services. A lot of the value comes from specific features—like cloud hosting or seamless integrations—rather than trying to sell a full, locked-down software package. That shift gives users way more flexibility and control, which is pretty different from how traditional software works. Overall, this was a very informative class discussion.
