# Part 1: 

## Go Project: Purpose of Code of Conduct 

The purpose of Go's Community Code of Conduct document is to provide the public with a set of guidelines on how to use Go's open-source software. It establishes a baseline for how they expect their users and contributors in their community to behave with one another. I believe that having this type of document for all projects is very beneficial because it sets an expectation for all users to treat one another with respect.

### Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

#### Differences Between Go and Contributor Covenant

Go clearly outlines three goals that represent the purpose of their Code of Conduct:  

1. To specify a baseline standard.  
2. To provide a mechanism for resolving conflict.  
3. To make their community welcoming for all users.  

The Contributor Covenant, in comparison, has a general pledge to foster an open and inclusive community. Furthermore, Go goes even more in-depth by including a specific section on **Conflict Resolution**. They emphasize multiple times throughout their Code of Conduct that it is helpful to have disagreements, but it is not acceptable to be disrespectful when addressing complaints. This emphasis suggests that there were likely instances where contributors were being rude or inconsiderate in the past.

## Code of Conduct Document for Eclipse  

[Eclipse Community Code of Conduct](https://eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php)

The main structural difference I see is that Eclipse has a **stricter enforcement and reporting procedure**, whereas Go seems to focus more on **self-moderation**. Eclipse has a detailed conduct committee and three separate sections:  

- **Investigation of Potential Code Violations**  
- **Actions**  
- **No Retaliation**  

These sections outline the specifics of what will happen if the Code of Conduct is violated. In contrast, Go’s reports go to the **Go Project Stewards**, but **not every complaint may receive a response**.  

I believe this difference in standards exists because **Eclipse is an independent foundation** that oversees a variety of projects and therefore requires strict legal governance. In contrast, **Go is an open-source project led by Google**, making it more **community-driven** in comparison.

# Part 2: Sugar Labs Code of Conduct  

The Sugar Labs Code of Conduct is based on **Ubuntu’s Code of Conduct**, an open-source operating system. Although the general principles promoted in both Codes of Conduct are similar—**fostering a diverse, inclusive, and supportive community**—the **Sugar Labs Code of Conduct is less structured and more informal**.  

The **Sugar learning platform is created for children**, helping them explore and learn. As a result, its Code of Conduct has a more **loosely defined outline for collaboration and respectfulness**.  

In comparison, **Go is created for developers**, so its Code of Conduct has **stricter guidelines** focused on fostering a **professional and inclusive technical environment**.
