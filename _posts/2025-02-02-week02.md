## Go Project: Purpose of Code of Conduct 


The purpose of Go's Community Code of Conduct document is to provide the public with a set of guidelines on how to use Go's open source software. It is to establish a baseline for how they expect their users and contributors in their community to behave with one another. I definitely believe that having this type of document for all projects is very beneficial because it sets an expectation for all users to treat one another with respect. 

Contributor Convenant Code of Conduct

2 Differences between Go and Contributor Convenant: Go clearly outlines 3 goals they have that represent the purpose of their Code of Conduct: 1) to specify a baseline standard, 2) to provide a mechanism for resolving conflict and 3) to make their community welcome for all users. The Contributor Convenant, in comparision has a general pledge to foster an open and inclusive community. Furthermore, Go goes even more in-depth by having a specific section outlined for "Conflict Resolution". They seem to emphasize multiple times throughout their Code of Conduct that is helpful to have disagreements, but not okay to be disrespectful about the way you address your complaints. It's only natural to think that their most likely must have been instances where contributors were being rude and inconsiderate.
