**Building Our Own Browser Add-On from Scratch**

My team chose to develop a browser add-on that will give users the capability to convert any two currency amounts (for example, Euros to Dollars). We came up with the idea because we all love traveling, so we thought that this would be a useful extension for travelers who need to figure out conversion rates between different currencies. I would say our greatest challenge is our inexperience with creating browser extensions. My team is rather inexperienced in JavaScript and browser extension development, so it's important to look online for resources.

So far, we have a working extension deployed for converting between USD, Euros, and Yen. However, I would like to expand on this capability by incorporating a third-party API before we present on Wednesday. I enjoyed working in this group setting because it allowed us to share different ideas amongst each other. When we worked on creating the extension, it was clear that some of us were better at Git, while others were stronger in coding, so it was helpful for us to rely on each other.
