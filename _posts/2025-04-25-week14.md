title: Week 14 - Week 1 Final Presentations + Progress Update

### Reflection on Other Presentations

This week marked the beginning of group presentations, and one that particularly caught my attention was Preswald. Their team had a great dynamic and presented in a way that felt polished and well-coordinated. What really stood out to me, though, was the startup they chose—a YC-backed company focused on building data apps with Python. The concept felt genuinely promising, and I could see the potential for it to succeed as the product continues to develop.

I was also impressed by how much progress their group made in just a few weeks. They walked us through several meaningful contributions, like implementing a sidebar and integrating an AI-powered chatbot that can answer user questions. What I found especially notable was how they managed to build a strong working relationship with the project's developers—it clearly elevated the quality of their contributions.

Another group that stood out to me was Hugging Face. They took on one of the most technically complex repositories I’ve ever seen, and I was genuinely impressed by their ambition. Contributing to such a well-established and widely used machine learning repository is no small feat—especially given the depth of knowledge typically required to navigate that kind of codebase. What made their work even more remarkable was the fact that only one member of their group had prior experience with machine learning. Despite that, they were able to make meaningful contributions and demonstrate a solid understanding of the tools and models they were working with. Their presentation showed not only technical growth but also a strong commitment to pushing their comfort zones, which I really admired.


### Group Progress

It’s still been a bit challenging to find impactful issues to work on through the website alone. However, while revisiting the learning paths, I noticed that the “Databases” section felt relatively underdeveloped—it only includes two lessons, and neither goes into much depth. Reflecting on my own experience learning about databases, I remembered how confusing it was to choose between SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL without guidance. That inspired me to begin drafting additional lesson content to help learners understand the differences between these options and when to use each. I’m planning to submit a pull request with those additions by the end of the week.

As a team, we’re now focused on finalizing our presentation and practicing before our presentation next Monday. As a whole we are aiming to complete any outstanding pull requests as soon as possible. All in all, I would say that contributing to The Odin Project has been a really meaningful experience, and we’re all excited to continue exploring open source beyond this class.
