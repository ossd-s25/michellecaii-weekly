**Go Project: Purpose of Code of Conduct**

The purpose of Go's Community Code of Conduct document is to provide the public with a set of guidelines on how to use Go's open source software. It is to establish a baseline for how they expect their users and contributors in their community to behave with one another. I definitely believe that having this type of document for all projects is very beneficial because it sets an expectation for all users to treat one another with respect.

**Contributor Convenant Code of Conduct Vs. Go's Code of Conduct**

2 Differences between Go and Contributor Convenant: Go clearly outlines 3 goals they have that represent the purpose of their Code of Conduct: 1) to specify a baseline standard, 2) to provide a mechanism for resolving conflict and 3) to make their community welcome for all users. The Contributor Convenant, in comparision has a general pledge to foster an open and inclusive community. Furthermore, Go goes even more in-depth by having a specific section outlined for "Conflict Resolution". They seem to emphasize multiple times throughout their Code of Conduct that is helpful to have disagreements, but not okay to be disrespectful about the way you address your complaints. It's only natural to think that their most likely must have been instances where contributors were being rude and inconsiderate.

**Eclipse's Code of Conduct (https://eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) Vs. Go's Code of Conduct**

The main difference in structure that I see is that for Eclipse, they have a more strict enforcement and reporting procedure, whereas Go seems to have a more self-moderation-focused Code of Conduct. Eclipse has a detailed conduct committee and they have three separate sections "Investigation of Potential Code Violations", "Actions", and "No Retaliations" that lay that the specifics on what will happen if the Code of Conduct will be violated. In comparison, the reports will go to the Go Project Stewards, but not every complaint may receive a response. I believe this difference is standards is most likley because Eclipse is an independent foundation that oversees a variety of projects so it needs a strict, legal goverance, whereas Go is an open-source project headed by Google, so it makes sense that it is more community-driven in comparison to Eclipse.

**Sugar Lab's Code of Conduct**

The Sugar Labs Code of Conduct is based on the Ubuntu's (an open-source operating system) Code of Conduct. Although the general ideas promoted in both Code of Conducts are similar (fostering a diverse, inclusive, supportive community), it's clear that the Sugar Labs Code of Conduct is less structured and more informal. The Sugar learning platform is created for children, to help them explore and learn, so there is a more loose outline for colaboration and respectfulness. In comparision, Go is created for developers, so its Code of Conduct has stricter guidelines regarding a creating a professional, inclusive technical environment.
