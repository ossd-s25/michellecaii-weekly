title: Week 6 - Contributions Update & Open Source Project Consideration
---

**Personal Contributions**

So far, my contributions have been relatively straightforward, mainly on Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap. I found it easiest to contribute to topics that align with my personal interests. Lately, I’ve been really into electronic music, and one of my favorite artists is Dom Dolla. My favorite contribution so far has been updating his Wikipedia page—it was genuinely very enjoyable to learn more about his life and career.

On the other hand, contributing to OpenStreetMap was more challenging in my opnion. It’s difficult to pinpoint missing or outdated map details unless you're very familiar with the area. This made it harder for me to feel confident about my personal edits. I also want to say, I want to complete more coding-related contributions or contributions to larger community-based projects, but it's hard to find ones that are ideal, that are still within my skillset.
