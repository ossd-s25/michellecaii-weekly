title: Week 1 - What is Open Source + Important Open Source Projects
---

When I think of the term 'open source' I imagine a giant group of people from all around the world discussing on how to best engineer a project. That's what I imagine underlies the initial purpose of open source: to bring together people from a variety of backgrounds who might differ in their interests and excel in their personal skillsets. However, I'm still relatively new towards open source projects and that's the main reason why I decided to take this class this semester. I want to learn more about what open source development is, and how I can contribute to different projects in the future. 

After doing some research on what open source really is, open source projects are defined as projects that are readily available to the public and it is software that can be freely used by the public. In comparision, closed source projects and private projects, if I had to guess, most commonly created by for-profit companies that contain company-sensitive information. A clear pro to closed source projects is by keeping some of the technology private and not readily available, the creators of the project can benefit financially from the sale and distribution of the project.
