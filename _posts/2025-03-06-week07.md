title: Week 7 - Choosing Semester Long Project & Team Work
---

### **Choosing our Semester Long Project** 

The project my group and I decided to choose for the rest of the semester is The Odin Project. Similar to FreeCodeCamp, this open source project is a free community resource focused particularly on web development skills. I really like this project because contributing to an educational platform that helps people learn and grow in tech feels incredibly meaningful to me. I am working with two other classmates on this project, and although I did not know them prior, I'm excited to build a stronger relationship through this group project together.

### **Updates on Teamwork** 

I would say our initial struggle was choosing a project. We were initially deciding between The Odin Project and another project named Mermaid, which is an open source project that converts code to easy-to-read flowcharts. We decided to go with The Odin Project in the end because it felt more beginning-friendly and easier to interact with their community. I'm excited to see what meaningful contributions we'll be able to make to The Odin Project.
